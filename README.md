# About Datasets
This repository has a raw dataset of over 30k datapoints 
(Raw_Skills_Dataset.csv) which contain technical skills and a lot of jargon 
mixed in. 

I have developed a code that cleaned this dataset and extracted
Technical (Hard) skills.

What does technical skill mean? Technical skills are demonstrable and 
quantifiable skills. They can be tested to prove their capacity in each hard 
skill an individual possesses. 
Sounded like blah, blah? I know, because it's much more difficult to 
explain this theoretically so how about i show what it means. I have 
attached some 900 random examples of technical skills 
(Example_Technical_Skills.csv), go through them to understand the 
pattern and sequence.
